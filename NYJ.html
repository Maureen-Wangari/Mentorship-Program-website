        <h1>Born A Crime by Trevor Noah</h1>
           <p> These two chapters dive into the life of a mixed-race child growing up during apartheid in South Africa raised by a strict christian mother .</p>
            
            <h1>1:Run</h1>
           <p>Trevor narrates the story of his mother’s unwavering faith and the challenges they faced due to the racial segregation Imposed by apartheid.<br>
            In this chapter it highlights the tribal conflicts between Zulu and Xhosa tribes.Being raised in a christian household,Trevor is still not  convinced<br>
            that they should got to church each and every sunday.On the other hand, Trevor’s mother is governed by church and she wouldn't by any of Trevor’s excuses to<br>
            don’t got to church.Trevor’s mother is determined to keep her son safe even if it means throwing him out of a moving car to save him from gang attack.</p>
           <h1>2:Born A Crime</h1>
           <p> Starts with apartheid and its oppressive laws.Trevor was born to a white father and a black mother,which that union was illegal at that time.<br>
            This chapter shows the cruelty of apartheid as Trevor’s existence was considered a crime.</p>
            
            <p> Connecting this issues to my county Nyeri,Its clear while the specific circumstances may differ,the theme of resilience in the face of misfortune are unversal.<br> 
            In Nyeri we also grapple with issues of water scarcity,climate change and land issues ,for instance ,mirroring the systemic injustices Trevor describes in his book.<br>
            Also in church relations there in my county there is interest of rich and average people’s church.</p>
