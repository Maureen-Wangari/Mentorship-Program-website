        <h1>Born A Crime by Trevor Noah</h1>
            
            <p>Because he was born into a society where it was forbidden for people of different races to be in relationships, Noah, born of mixed races, is born a crime </p>
           <p>Trevor narrates the story of his mother’s unwavering faith and the challenges they faced due to the racial segregation Imposed by apartheid.<br>
            He shows the tribal conflicts between Zulu and Xhosa tribes.Being raised in a christian household,Trevor is still not  convinced<br>
            that they should got to church each and every sunday.On the other hand, Trevor’s mother is governed by church and she wouldn't by any of Trevor’s excuses not.<br>
            Trevor’s mother is determined to keep her son safe even if it means throwing him out of a moving car to save him from gang attack.</p>
           <p>Noah shares hilarious tales about his wayward behavior and his mother's severe discipline. Their relationship is most defined in the face of hardship</p>
           <p> The book reflects apartheid oppressive laws. Trevor being born of a white father and a black mother, was considered a crime.</p>
            
            <p>It's clear while the specific circumstances may differ,the theme of resilience in the face of misfortune is universal.<br> 
                but through every hardship, a mother will bring down all walls to protect her children even when they don't realize it.</p>
            <p>In Kiambu we grapple with issues of water scarcity,climate change and land issues mirroring the systemic injustices Trevor describes in his book.<br>
            Also in church relations there in my county there is interest in rich and average people’s position in churches.</p>
